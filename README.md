Artificial Neural Network to Solve System Of ODEs and Schwarzschild Solution for bound orbit
This is an implementation of a novel way of solving system of linear or higher order ordinary differential equations
The advantage over the conventional Numerical method solutions is that it gives continuous and differentiable functional solutions
Here the system is used to solve the schwarzschild geodesic equation for bound orbit
